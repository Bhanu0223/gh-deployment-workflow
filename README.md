# gh-deployment-workflow
This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions, triggering the deployment only when index.html changes.


## How it works
- Any change to `index.html` on the `main` branch triggers deployment
- GitHub Actions builds and deploys the site
- The site is hosted using GitHub Pages
- added the flow
